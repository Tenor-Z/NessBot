# NessBot
A Player Bot for Earthbound

# Overview
In Earthbound, there is a feature during battles, there is an option dubbed Auto-Fight which plays the fight for you while you go elsewhere. It essentially finishes the encounter so you can get back to the overworld.
Fortunately, once the fight is over, it is up to you to find another enemy, making it your responsibility to grind your party and level them up for the next Sanctuary Guardian.

This is where NessBot comes into play.

See, with this tool, you can grind without ever having to touch your keyboard. You can come back to the game and your party will be ready for the next tough battle, all without you wasting several hours fighting enemy after
enemy.

Note: This only works with Snes9x (ZSnes isn't relatively used anymore)
